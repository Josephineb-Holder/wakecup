                    <p>
                        The year was 1980 when WakeCup was imagined after 
                         experiencing some of the finest 
                        coffees on an educational 
                         trip to Brazil and the South Americas.
                         We wanted to break the
                        monotony of low profile, non-descript coffee that was 
                         doing rounds in those cafeterias of the 80s. But life threw 
                         us in a different direction, and we ended up in the tech industry 
                         with a desire to get into the world of coffee someday. In 2005, 
                        that dream was brought to fruition when we quit our jobs and 
                         started WakeCup. 
                        Ever since then, we've gone around the world
                        in search for the best beans and we couldn't
                        be happier. We love 
                        spreading smiles through our coffee. Our quest has taken us around 
                        the world to some of the finest plantations and estates, many of whom  work with us directly or 
                        indirectly.
                        In 2016 we started conducting workshops and became the primary sponsors of the Bean King 
                        Champion contest. Our baristas have won global accolades and we love serving cuppa 
                        goodness.
